# Computational tools: the art of programming

This is a repository that will be used in order to use, practice and work together with the tools that git offers us.

the selected codes were: paint, snake and pacman

Paint explanation:

we created a basic game to create figures like lines, rectangles, triangles, squares, circles. We added a function to change the width size with different letter commands. As well we added the option to change the color figures to: black, white, green, blue, yellow and red. This was possible using the onkey function, with this we were able to use the keyboard keys; we assigned specific keys for the selected commands.

Snake explanation: 
In this program all the team members made a branch in GitHub to edit the program simultaneously, Joya in the code change the keys to move the snake across the board, instead of using the arrows in the keyboard the user will use the keys: w,a,s,d to move, Gabriel managed to make the snake change in various random colors every time the game was repeated, among which red was not possible, and finally I change the code in order to make the snake move faster in the board giving this choice to the user choosing a number to change the speed. 

PacMan
in this code each one of us did different things and edited the code from their own Branch
Gabriel changed the size of the ghosts, Sebastian changed the board and Max changed the speed of the ghosts.

we all proceed to add, commit and push our changes, finally we merged the branches so all the changes go to a main code in the main Branch.
