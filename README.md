# Computational tools: the art of programming

This is a repository that will be used in order to use, practice and work together with the tools that git offers us.

the selected codes were: paint, snake and pacman

Paint explanation:

we created a basic game to create figures like lines, rectangles, triangles, squares, circles. We added a function to change the width size with different letter commands. As well we added the option to change the color figures to: black, white, green, blue, yellow and red. This was possible using the onkey function, with this we were able to use the keyboard keys; we assigned specific keys for the selected commands.
